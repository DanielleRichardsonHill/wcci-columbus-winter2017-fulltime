# Professional Portfolio

## Overview

Create a portfolio site highlighting your work that can be shared with potential employers. Focus first on building a good structure that you can later style with CSS.

Your site should have several sections. These could be sections of a single page or multiple pages. Just remember the page that will be loaded/seen first is `index.html`.

Your projects section should include at least three projects. Pick those of which you are most proud. You can add/update/remove projects from this section as time goes on. Consider creating project pages using GitHub Pages (see https://help.github.com/articles/user-organization-and-project-pages/#project-pages) for html-based projects and linking to those (rather than the repository) in order to demonstrate your work. 

Employers may look at your site on a mobile device, so build a responsive layout and verify its responsiveness after it is published to GitHub.
